#### Undefined Vs Null in JavaScript

** Both undefined and null represent the absence of a meaningful value, but they have different purposes.
Undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables in certain situations such as a variable that is declared but not initialized will have the value undefined.

** Null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the deliberate absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate "No Value" and explicitly shows that a variable or object property should have no value.

#### use of map() and forEach()

*** forEach() is used to perform side effects like logging or updating external variables. It does not return anything. map() is used for transforming data. It returns a new array with the transformed values, leaving the original array unchanged.
